* Introduction
  This project aims to find the shortest path between two wiki pages. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game][Wiki Game]].

  We use a database provided by [[http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-topcats.html][snap.stanford.edu]] to create a directed unweighted graph. We traverse this graph to find the shortest distance between two wikipedia pages whose names are provided by the user.

  This project is implemented in Java.

  It is planned to use breadth first search to find all possible shortest paths.
