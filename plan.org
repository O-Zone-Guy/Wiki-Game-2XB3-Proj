   - Input
     - Multiple Types
       - User inputs two names (wikipages)
       - ~ user inputs one name (wiki page)
   - Processing
     - Convert string to related node id
     - Find the paths such that all possible paths are <= |path|
   - Interaction
     1. Take user input
     2. Say if we found a link or not
        - If found a link keep going, else terminate
     3. Ask user for a guess about the path length
        - The number of guesses is yet to be decided
        - Allow user to skip guessing
     4. Show the output.
   - Output
     1. The length
     2. The actual path
        + Should be sorted using lexicographical to sort the paths
          + Least obvious
            + Least category change
       - A module to wrap around the SQLite module provided by Java
     - Interface
       - Responsible for input and output
       - State of interaction process
         - Input step, etc.
     - Traversal Module
       - Responsible for finding the shortest path between two nodes
   - ADT
     - Path
       - Stores the solutions sequences
     - Node
       - node number
       - set of neighbouring nodes numbers, not ADT
** DONE Distribute modules work
